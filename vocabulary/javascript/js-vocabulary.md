# General JS terms

## Document

     This is an object name that refers specifically to the HTML document that contains the Javascript.

## Errors

     An error message box is displayed when something in the script's format or verbage disallows it to run. The two type of errors you'll encounter are called RunTime and Syntax errors.

### Run-Time Error

     A Run-Time error is an error that is produced when incorrect terms are used in the Javascript code. An incorrect command or out of sequence format will throw this type of error.

### Syntax Error

     A Syntax error is produced when a script's format or shape is incorrect, a misspelling is found, or text is not recognized. Syntax errors are also thrown when you have opened a command, but then do not close it.

## Instance

     The instance of a command is contained in parentheses immediately following the command. The Instance contains information about what an object is to do or how a method is to be carried out.

## Method

     A Method is a command that tells how an object is to be acted upon.

## Lint

     Lint is a catchall phrase that describes formal blemishes in the code, as well as deviations from an
     agreed upon 'standard' syntax. It is important to note that lint will not prevent your code from running.
     It is an issue because lint will make your code difficult for other developers to read and understand.

## Linting

     Linting is the process of enforcing clean and uniform syntax and keeping code free of lint (see above).

## Object

     An Object is something that exists such as the HTML Document, the browser window, or the date and time. An object can also be something that you create through a function.

## Variable

     A symbol representing a quantity that assumes a range of values.

## Write

     Write is a method that acts upon the object document to post text to a page.
